## Backstory

In the small village, there lived a group of young people who were all huge fans of DanTDM, the popular content creator. They spent countless hours watching his videos and discussing his latest creations.

One day, tragedy struck the village. A powerful storm swept through, destroying homes, crops, and everything in its path. Many people lost their lives, including the parents of the young DanTDM fans.

The devastated group of youngsters vowed to honor their parents' memory and find a way to rebuild the village. As they searched through the wreckage, they discovered a lone Feraligatr, a powerful and fierce Pokémon.

In honor of their fallen loved ones and their shared love of DanTDM and Pokémon, the group decided to name themselves "The Feras" after the Feraligatr they had found. They also made it their mission to become strong and skilled like their namesake, so they could protect their village and prevent another tragedy from happening again.

The Feras trained tirelessly, pushing themselves to their limits, and eventually became a formidable team. They honed their skills in battle and learned to work together to overcome any obstacle.

Now, The Feras travel together, helping those in need and protecting the weak. Their loyalty to each other and their community is unwavering, and their bond only grows stronger with each challenge they face. -->
